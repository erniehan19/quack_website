                            exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any dispute which may arise in connection with these Legal Terms.

                        <p>
                            <b>Informal Negotiations</b><br/><br/>

                            To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) 
                            brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute 
                            (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written 
                            notice from one Party to the other Party.<br/><br/>

                            <b>Binding Arbitration</b><br/><br/>

                            Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Legal Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to 
                            and finally resolved by the International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to the 
                            Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is considered as the part of this clause. The number of arbitrators shall be two (2).<br/><br/>

                            The seat, or legal place, or arbitration shall be Calgary, Canada. The language of the proceedings shall be English. The governing law of these Legal Terms 
                            shall be substantive law of Canada.<br/><br/>

                            <b>Restrictions</b><br/><br/>

                            The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall 
                            be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; 
                            and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.<br/><br/>

                           <b>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</b> <br/><br/>

                            The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any 
                            Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising 
                            from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or 
                            unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute 
                            shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of 
                            that court.
