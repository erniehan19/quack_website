                            <ul className="custom-bullets">
                                <li><p>whether we collect and use your personal information;</p></li>

                            In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer 
                            request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request. <br/><br/>

                            <b>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</b> <br/><br/>

                            We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights. <br/><br/>

                            <b>Verification process</b> <br/><br/>

                            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. 
                            These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, 
                            depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we 
                            already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification 
                            methods as the circumstances dictate. <br/><br/>

                            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid 
                            requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, 
                            we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such 
                            additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you. <br/><br/>
